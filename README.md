"Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface" is a command line Node app

*What does this app do?*


*How is this app useful?*
This familiarized the npm package manager through using four different packages. Axios npm was used to capture requests and responses to APIs. I learned how to hide API keys by utilizing "dotenv" nmp package and ".gitignore" file that designates which files to not upload to GitHub. I can use this information to go back to the apps created in the first half of the program and hide their API keys.

*Future directions*
